# Simplenote Command-line Interface

Currently just a way to do offsite backups via command-line but will eventually
be a more full-featured [simplenote](http://simplenoteapp.com) client.

# Development Status

This is currently in early development (the library hasn't been completed yet).

# Files

- simplenote.py: This is the library that is used by sn.py.
- sn.py: The frontend command line interface.

# Initial setup

Copy config.ini.default to config.ini and add your login information.
